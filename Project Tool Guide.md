Collaboration and Communication
* Skype and Teamviewer
<p>Skype is a communication tool, it allows individuals and groups to communicate through both the Skype application as well as to mobiles and lanlines. There is also the option to allow video calls and screen-sharing which can be incredibly beneficial to users when using the service to collaborate on, troubleshoot or debug project deliveerables in real time. Skype can be used in conjunction with Teamviewer which is a remote access tool. Teamviewer expands on Skypes screensharing functionality whereby it is possible to not only see another users desktop, but also interact with it as though there was direct access. This allows users to creatively and productively collaborate together with ease regardless of physical distance between them.</p>
