**Project Tool Guide**
<p> The following recommened tools listed below have all been chosen with the main feature of online accessibility. This will provide the project team the power of being able to work on the project from any location and give the team more flexabily and control throughout the project life cycle. All of the tools will give the project manager and team members up to the minute infomation and the latest expected features of project tools. The tools complement each other to a degree assisting with all aspects of the scrum methodlogy and the project practise's we have recommended in the previous section. </p>


**Collaboration and Communication**
<p>Skype is a communication tool, it allows individuals and groups to communicate through both the Skype application as well as to mobiles and landlines. We feel all meetings and communications that do not require face to face can be carried out using the service, daily standups can be done using google hangouts. There is also the option to allow video calls and screen-sharing which can be incredibly beneficial to users when using the service to collaborate on, troubleshoot or debug project deliveerables in real time. Skype can be used in conjunction with Teamviewer which is a remote access tool. </p>


**Requirements Engineering**
<p>We suggest for planning poker a very simple and fast way to do this process would be using planningpoker.com, this website allows the team and scrum manager to do the process all online. After a very simple signup and setup the entire game is then played using laptops or a phone app and provides an easy to view exportable summary.
Once the user stories have been identified and product backlog produced, this can been dirrectly imported into Trello where the first sprint can be displayed directly onto the scrum task board.</p>


**Project Planning and Tracking**
<p> The gnatt chart can be produced using Microsoft project, the project manager will be able to analyze resources, budgets and timelines. Also, project managers can easily measure progress and anticipate resource needs with detailed and easily customizable  reports.
Trello is a project management tool that allows the entire scrum board to be availabe online with the whole team being able to view and update. Again this allows the entire team to keep up with how the sprint is progressing and also allows them to move their indivual cards and attach notes to any of the tasks for the whole project.
Google Docs we feel would be usful to archive documents related to the project as it allows a number of document formats including word documents and spreadsheets. This will allow the team to have any infomation they require anytime they may need it.</p>


**Managing Change**
<p>The change management plan will be the offical document that will provide how any changes to the project will be handled, the tools that will assist in this process are goggle doc's that can store all the change request forms, goggle hangouts where the initial change requests can be discussed in the daily team meetings and sprint reviews. In Trello notes can be added to the cards along with updated checklists and finally Github will provide the actual change with code updates on different branches.</p>


**Quality Assurance**
<p> We recommend the actual code of the project to be saved by Github. Using this as the main code repository will allow version control with indivual team members being able to sign off on any changes made and view all of the code of the project as needed.
Github will ensure that the project is maintained and kept up to date and can be used across all smart and mobile devices.
Testing of the software can also be easily tracked with github and changes that need to be made can be noted directly to the code base.</p>
