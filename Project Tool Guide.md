**Project Tool Guide**

<p> The following recommened tools listed below have all been chosen with the main feature of online accessablity. This will provide the project team the power of being able to work on the project from any location and give the team more flexabily when it comes to the project. All of the tools will give the project manager and team members up to the minute infomation and control. 
</p>

**Collaboration and Communication**
* Skype and Teamviewer
<p>Skype is a communication tool, it allows individuals and groups to communicate through both the Skype application as well as to mobiles and landlines. We feel all meetings and communications that do not require face to face can be carried out using the service. There is also the option to allow video calls and screen-sharing which can be incredibly beneficial to users when using the service to collaborate on, troubleshoot or debug project deliveerables in real time. Skype can be used in conjunction with Teamviewer which is a remote access tool. </p>

<p>TeamTeamviewer expands on Skypes screensharing functionality whereby it is possible to not only see another users desktop, but also interact with it as though there was direct access. This allows users to creatively and productively collaborate together with ease regardless of physical distance between them.</p>

**Requirements Engineering**
*  We suggest for planning poker a very simple and fast way to do this process would be using planningpoker.com, this website allows the team and scrum manager to do the excersice all online. After a very simple signup and setup the entire game is then played using laptops or a phone app and provides an easy to view exportable summary.</p>

**Project Planning and Tracking**

* Microsoft Project
<p> The gnatt chart can be produced using Microsoft project, the project manager will be able to analyze resources, budgets and timelines. Also, project managers can easily measure progress and anticipate resource needs with detailed and easily customizable  reports. </p>

* Trello
<p>Trello is a project management tool that allows the entire scrum board to be availabe online with the whole team being able to view and update. Again this allows the entire team to keep up with how the sprint is progressing and also allows them to move their indivual cards and attach notes to any of the tasks for the whole project.</p>

* Google Docs
<p>Google Docs we feel would be usful to archive documents related to the project as it allows a number of document formats including word documents and spreadsheets. this will allow the team to have any infomation they require anytime they may need it.</p>

**Quality Assurance**
* GitHub
<p> We recommend the actual code of the project to be saved by Github. Using this as the main code repository will allow version control with indivual team members being able to sign off on any changes made and view all of the code of the project as needed.
Github will ensure that the project is maintained and kept up to date and can be used across all smart and mobile devices.
Testing of the software can also be easily tracked with github with and changes that need to be made noted directly to the code base,
