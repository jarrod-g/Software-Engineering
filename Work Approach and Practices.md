**Work Approach & Practices**
**How will you do this work?**
Despite not being a software development project we will use aspects from an agile development process approach such as standups, storyboarding on Trello, GitHub for version control.
The work in this project will be split evenly amongst group members with certain members having specialty areas to focus on. The allocation of this work will be decided upon after the initial two week research period whereby we will use our Trello board to manage the work that needs to be done and timelines to team members.
We will be using GitHub to manage our actual project tasks whereby we will have different team members collaborate on the same work as set out in our Trello board.


**What approach or practices will you use to ensure you produce the best products in a timely manner?**
Regular team meetings will take place after the initial research period. In these meetings we evaluate other team members work and raise any issues that become apparent. We will use these meetings as a chance to help control the timeline of the project.
As well as meetings, we will have deadlines for work to be completed. These deadlines will be set to be ahead of schedule so that we have time to discuss within the group and make changes we all agree on.


**How will you make use of principles and practices that have been shown to be effective (see Meyer 2014, p154)**
*Short Iterations
	*As per our work breakdown structure all deliverables have been broken down into tasks to be complete in one to two week intervals.
*Continuous Integration
	*Our use of the principle of continuous integration will use the version control cloud service GitHub where we will collaboratively work on tasks and update them as required.
*Delivering wiki
	*As a group we will work to understand all of the tasks that are required for final project completion which will be delivered via the project wiki.
*Velocity
	*Trello will be used to track and manage assigned tasks to ensure they are completed to a high standard and in a timely manner. This will also provide current information of the overall progress in comparison to our work breakdown structure.
*Testing (proofreading)
	*The Trello cards for each task will contain checkboxes for other group members to tick off as they have completed proof reading, the last person to proof will move the tasks card to ‘done’. GitHub will also facilitate this by forcing collaborative members to approve changes made by other members to the project tasks.
