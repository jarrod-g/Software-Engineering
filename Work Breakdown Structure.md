*Work Breakdown Structure*

We have chosen Case Study 3, Product: Multiplayer interactive game. 

The team has decided to research other similar game development companies, and peer reviewed literature about small companies that have made the move into becoming medium sized enterprises. Over the 2 week break it has been decided research will be carried out by each team member generally and each individual will be also tasked with a specific subject area to  focus on.
Meetings, will be carried out over the study break at times assigned using voip.
When sufficient research has been carried out the team will then present its findings to start the main body of this project. The time box for this research is 2 weeks, with the remaining 4 weeks to produce the deliverables set for project.  
A trello board has been set up for the group and after the research process Trello will be updated with a detailed project plan with individual tasks.
Github will be used for version control of all deliverable documents. 
The team feels that after our research period is complete we can provide accurate timeboxed tasks with the trello application, below is a estimate with out the tasks broken down into detail.
