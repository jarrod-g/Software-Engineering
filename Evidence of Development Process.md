#Evidence of Development Process

* Collaboration & Communication
  * In order to collaborrate and communicate, we used a number of tools including Discord, Trello, Google Drive and GitHub
    * Discord
      <br>Our group used discord in order to communicate. It predominantly served as a supplemental communication device
      to stand ups. It allowed us to clarify aspects of face to face meetings, arrange these meetings and also pass details
      and important information to any members who were unable to attend a stand up for some reason which they alerted the other
      members to via Discord.
