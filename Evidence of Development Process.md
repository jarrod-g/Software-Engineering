#Evidence of Development Process

* Collaboration & Communication
  * In order to collaborrate and communicate, we used a number of tools including Discord, Trello, Google Drive and GitHub
    * Discord
      <br>Our group used discord in order to communicate. It predominantly served as a supplemental communication device to stand ups. It allowed us to clarify aspects of face to face meetings, arrange these meetings and also pass details and important information to any members who were unable to attend a stand up for some reason which they alerted the other members to via Discord.
      <br>Discord provides a web interface, Windows and Mac applications as well as apps on both Google Play and the iOS store, this meant that no matter what, provided group members had internet access (which was 90% of the time), we could all communicate with each other in a timely manner.

    * Trello
      <br>Our group used Trello in order to plan our project with regards to what needed to be done, who was going to do it and when it needed to be done by. We set up lists to represent 'unstarted deliverables', 'works in progress', 'to proof/edit' and then 'complete'. Within the 'unstarted deliverables', we created cards to represent each deliverable and moved them through the other lists as we progressed with them.
    * Google Drive
      <br>Google Drive served as our main shared storage where we added important documents that were not apart of our deliverables including the assignment outline, contact details, research files and minutes from meetings.
