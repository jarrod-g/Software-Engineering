#Evidence of Development Process

* Collaboration & Communication
  * In order to collaborrate and communicate, we used a number of tools including Discord, Trello, Google Drive and GitHub
    * Discord
      <br>Our group used discord in order to communicate. It predominantly served as a supplemental communication device to stand ups. It allowed us to clarify aspects of face to face meetings, arrange these meetings and also pass details and important information to any members who were unable to attend a stand up for some reason which they alerted the other members to via Discord.
      <br>Discord provides a web interface, Windows and Mac applications as well as apps on both Google Play and the iOS store, this meant that no matter what, provided group members had internet access (which was 90% of the time), we could all communicate with each other in a timely manner.

    * Google Drive
      <br>Google Drive served as our main shared storage where we added important documents that were not apart of our deliverables including the assignment outline, contact details, research files and minutes from meetings. THis allowed all members of the group to compile information relevant to the project in a way that is was easily accessible to all

* Planning and Tracking
  * Trello
      <br>Our group used Trello in order to plan our project with regards to what needed to be done, who was going to do it and when it needed to be done by. We set up lists to represent 'unstarted deliverables', 'works in progress', 'to proof/edit' and then 'complete'. Within the 'unstarted deliverables', we created cards to represent each deliverable and moved them through the other lists as we progressed with them.

* Version Control
  * Github
      <br>GitHub was our primary version control tool as it allows people to propose changes to documents, review exactly what one collaborator has added and removed from each document as well as track these changes based on time and/or collaborators. This meant that multiple people could work on several branches/versions of the project at the same time then merge their work to result in the most up to date version of the project. We found that due to the nature of the project and our workflow, there only tended to be one and occasionally two branches
