**Tool/Practice Learning Package**

Select one tool or practice that you have recommended and prepare a learning package that would
help a team quickly upskill to include the tool/practice in their daily process. You must include:

* Goals.
	*Only so much can be decided about the goals at this point, need confirmation of what practices/tool we will be looking at. Howevery it will go somthing like this. "The goal his training session is to assist with peoples understandingn of ________ and by introducingthem to key concepts and practices used when _______. The end result should be individuals who are comfortable with the underlying concepts and principles of _______ and should be able to undertake _______ confidently by themselves "
	
* Target Audience â€“ assume people that are not familiar with the tool/practice.
	*Again need to know the tool/practice we are looking at before we can point out who will be needing to be trained in it.
* Learning plan
	*(Again need to know selected tool/practice but there are acouple of ways that whatever we choose could be taught) 
	*Direct Instruction
	*Independant study
	*Expetimantal Learning- process of making meaning from direct experience(SCRUMIA, 2013). eg through:
		*simulations
		*role playing
		*games
			*any contest among players operating under rules for an objective (SCRUMIA resource)
			*The SCRUMIA resource has a list of Seven games that can be played to teach SCRUM, any of these could be addapted to work with whatever practice/tool we will work with
* Learning resources. You are free to include resources produced by others where they are freely available and correctly referenced.
	*SCRUMIA pg.2678
* Learning activity. At least one activity to support learning. This should be developed by you.
	*Especially for this need to know what practice/tool we are looking at
	
Assume that you have **4 hours** available to upskill the team. It may be used in a single session or
divided across multiple sessions

* Beginning with games that illustrate key points followed by hands on practices will be an effective means of conveying neccissary information over the four hour window available. This will obviously be expanded into more detail once a practice/tool is selected
